# ergodash_bepo
My personal Ergodash layout made to be used in conjuction with OS-level b√©po (which is the reason behind the placement of most of the symbols on the keyboard)

Features:
- Interesting modifiers placements. Pls help.
- Windows and MacOS layouts
- Full OS-specific navigation layer letting you keep your shortcuts from one OS to the other
- Double tap spacebar for enter
- Double tap alt for underscore
- Double tap other modifiers for modifier+shift

TODO:
- Double tap layer for alt+layer, buggy when I tried to implement it for some reason.
- More ways to access key chords based on thumb keys, especially cmd+ctrl and alt+enter
